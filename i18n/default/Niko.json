	"niko_dialogue.firstVisit_Mine": "You went down into the mines? I don't know if I'd be brave enough to do that...",
	"niko_dialogue.GreenRainFinished": "That green rain was so weird. Do you think magic had anything to do with it?",
	"niko_dialogue.MovieInvite_Invited": "I'd love to see a movie with you!$h",
	"niko_dialogue.DumpsterDiveComment": "@, don't you think that's a little gross?#$b#Wait, are you doing it for a case?",

	"niko_dialogue.Wed2": "%pet is soooo cute! Say hi for me?#$b#The closest thing I've ever had to a pet was the dandelion sprites... but they were really mean.#$b#And also I could never let them out of their jar or else they would try to possess me again.#$e#It's a long story...",
	"niko_dialogue.Thu2": "Hi @! Have you harvested anything good lately?",
	"niko_dialogue.Fri2": "Hi @! I like your shirt. Is it new?",
	"niko_dialogue.Sat2": "I like taking walks in Cindersap Forest. I stay away from dandelions, though. Last time I wandered into a patch of them I ended up being possessed by a pair of dandelion sprites, who are *not* as cute as they sound. ",
	"niko_dialogue.Sun2": "I can't wait for fall. I love it when the leaves change color and the weather gets chilly.",
	
	"niko_dialogue.Mon4": "I'm so tired today. I was up too late reading last night, but I just had to finish the chapter!",
	"niko_dialogue.Tue4": "What's Gus serving for lunch tomorrow?#$e#Ever since coming back, sometimes food tastes like dust. Edwin says it's a ghost thing.",
	"niko_dialogue.Wed4": "Have the boys ever told you about the time Charles got possessed by a hellhound?",
	"niko_dialogue.Thu4": "You should grow more tea on your farm. I bet you could come up with some really interesting blends.",
	"niko_dialogue.Fri4": "I've got to get to the library soon. The newest installment of My Demon Lover just came out!#$b#The last one ended on such a bad cliffhanger...",
	"niko_dialogue.Sat4": "Charles has been showing me all sorts of cool things ghosts can do! I'm not very good at any of it yet, though.",
	"niko_dialogue.Sun4": "Edwin came over last night to watch scary movies, but I think he was only pretending to be scared.#$e#That's okay, I was plenty scared enough for both of us.",

	"niko_dialogue.Thu6": "You always look so busy, @. I hope you give yourself time to relax sometimes!",
	"niko_dialogue.Fri6": "Sometimes I think Charles is way sadder than he pretends to be. I wish he knew it's okay to be sad sometimes.",

	"niko_dialogue.Sun6": "Do you ever have time to write letters? We could be penpals!",
	
	"niko_dialogue.Mon8": "I'm glad Crystal has her memories back. She's worried she's a bad person, but if you ask me, she's the same as always.",
	"niko_dialogue.Tue8": "I wonder if Crystal will be free to hang out later. We could go to the beach!#$b#Would you like to come?",
	"niko_dialogue.Wed8": "What's your favorite food you grow on your farm? I have some recipes I've been wanting to try. ",
	"niko_dialogue.Thu8": "I've never gone fishing. My dad always said he was going to take me, but then he died.",
	"niko_dialogue.Fri8": "Sometimes it's hard to make myself leave my room. Crystal really helped with that when I met her, though.",
	"niko_dialogue.Sat8": "Can I tell you a secret?#$e#I've never kissed anyone before.",
	"niko_dialogue.Sun8": "If you ever want to borrow some of my manga, just let me know.#$b#I'll pick ones I think you'd like!",
	
	"niko_dialogue.Mon10": "I should write to my mom... She lives all the way in Osaka. It's hard to find the words for what to write, though.",
	"niko_dialogue.Tue10": "It's been really nice helping the boys out with their cases again. Just like old times!",
	"niko_dialogue.Wed10": "Sometimes I have nightmares of Esther's house... Don't tell anyone else, please.$s",
	"niko_dialogue.Thu10": "If Edwin corrects you, that means he likes you. He also likes being right, but it means more when he takes the time to teach you something.",
	"niko_dialogue.Fri10": "I think it's neat that Crystal can read minds. Sometimes I wish I had that power.#$e#Then I could tell if someone is just pretending to be nice.",
	"niko_dialogue.Sat10": "Do you ever miss your old life? Sometimes I do, but I like this one way more.",

	"niko_dialogue.spring_12": "Are you going to participate in the egg hunt tomorrow?",

	"niko_dialogue.fall_15": "The petting zoo is my favorite part of the fair tomorrow.#$b#Marnie's animals are so adorable.",
	"niko_dialogue.fall_26": "Do you have a costume for Spirit's Eve?#$e#I thought it would be funny to wear a sheet and go as a ghost, but I didn't want to wreck any of mine by cutting holes in them.#$b#Plus they all have cute designs on them, so none of them are actually white.",
	"niko_dialogue.winter_24": "I love the holidays. In Osaka, my family and I always celebrated the new year by playing games before eating osechi.",
