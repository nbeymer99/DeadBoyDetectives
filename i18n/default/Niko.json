	"niko_dialogue.Wed2": "%pet is soooo cute! Say hi for me?#$b#The closest thing I've ever had to a pet was the dandelion sprites... but they were really mean.#$b#And also I could never let them out of their jar or else they would try to possess me again.#$e#It's a long story...",

	"niko_dialogue.Fri2": "Hi @! I like your shirt. Is it new?",
	"niko_dialogue.Sat2": "I like taking walks in Cindersap Forest. I stay away from dandelions, though. Last time I wandered into a patch of them I ended up being possessed by a pair of dandelion sprites, who are *not* as cute as they sound. ",

	"niko_dialogue.Fri4": "I've got to get to the library soon. The newest installment of My Demon Lover just came out!#$b#The last one ended on such a bad cliffhanger...",
	"niko_dialogue.Sat4": "Charles has been showing me all sorts of cool things ghosts can do! I'm not very good at any of it yet, though.",

	"niko_dialogue.Sun6": "Do you ever have time to write letters? We could be penpals!",

	"niko_dialogue.Mon10": "I should write to my mom... She lives all the way in Osaka. It's hard to find the words for what to write, though.",
	"niko_dialogue.Tue10": "It's been really nice helping the boys out with their cases again. Just like old times!",
	"niko_dialogue.Wed10": "Sometimes I have nightmares of Esther's house... Don't tell anyone else, please.$s",
	"niko_dialogue.Thu10": "If Edwin corrects you, that means he likes you. He also likes being right, but it means more when he takes the time to teach you something.",
	"niko_dialogue.Fri10": "I think it's neat that Crystal can read minds. Sometimes I wish I had that power.#$e#Then I could tell if someone is just pretending to be nice.",

	"niko_dialogue.fall_26": "Do you have a costume for Spirit's Eve?#$e#I thought it would be funny to wear a sheet and go as a ghost, but I didn't want to wreck any of mine by cutting holes in them.#$b#Plus they all have cute designs on them, so none of them are actually white.",
