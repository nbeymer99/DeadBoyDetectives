			"Introduction": "Nice to meet you! I'm Crystal. I moved here recently for, um, work.#$e#Wait... you can see ghosts too? Oh, thank god.#$b#Yeah, me, Charles, and Edwin--they're the local overly co-dependent teenage ghosts, if you haven't met them yet--decided to open up a branch of the detective agency here.",
			"cc_Begin": "I heard you have a whole quest to rejuvenate the community center and everything.#$b#Just between you and me, I think that wizard guy is kind of unhinged.",
			"cc_Boulder": "I saw a bunch of shiny rocks in the river the other night.#$b#My parents used to have a lake house and I would spend hours panning for gold on the shore. Never found anything, though.",
			"cc_Bus": "We can finally visit other towns? Good, I was feeling a little cooped up here.",
			"cc_Minecart": "Sure, can't get a decent phone signal out here, but somehow you got a whole minecart system working. Good job, I guess.",
			"cc_Complete": "The community center looks a lot nicer now. Charles and Edwin might be pissed about the increased foot traffic below them, though.",
			"movieTheater": "I'm so busy I don't know when I'll ever have time, but it's nice to know we can go to the movies now.",
			"firstVisit_Mine": "You look rough. You haven't been visiting those mines alone, have you?",
			"GreenRainFinished": "That green rain was absolutely crazy. Are we sure it wasn't, like, poisonous?",
			
			"MovieInvite_Invited": "I'd love to go to the movies with you.$h",
			"DumpsterDiveComment": "I can't really judge, but when they found me dumpster diving, it was because I was possessed by a demon. Just saying.",
			//"FlowerDance_Accept_Spouse": "",
			"FlowerDance_Accept": "I'd love to!$h",
			"FlowerDance_Decline": "Umm, maybe next year.",
			"divorced": "God, can't you just leave me alone?",
			
			// GENERIC DIALOGUE
		    "Mon": "Winter is my favorite season. The valley is so still and quiet.", 
			"Tue": "Last night's episode of Murder After Dark was so crazy. Have you seen it yet?",
			"Wed": "It's really great that you can see ghosts too. It gets a little old, having to pretend like I'm not talking to thin air.",
			"Thu": "I have class all day on Thursdays. Skipping a bunch of school really sucks when you have to make it up later.",
			"Fri": "You moved here from the city? Do you miss anything about it?#$b#Sometimes I miss the nightlife, but also that's not really me anymore.",
			"Sat": "I can't wait until the weather is nice enough for sunbathing and swimming.",
			"Sun": "The good thing about Pelican Town is that people don't really look at me too weirdly for talking to ghosts. I guess they're used to things being a little strange around here.",

			"Mon2": "Ugh, I stayed up *way* too late last night helping the boys with our current case.", 
			"Tue2": "You haven't seen any medieval-looking ghost girls, have you? We're working on a case right now and she was a witness",
			"Wed2": "I think Abigail has a crush on Sebastian.#$b#Sorry, I'm trying to gossip less, but old habits...",
			"Thu2": "I have class all day on Thursdays. Skipping a bunch of school really sucks when you have to make it up later.",
			"Fri2": "It's a good thing the town is so small, because I never learned how to drive, and I can't mirror hop like the boys.",
			"Sat2": "Thank God it's Saturday. I need a day to myself.",
			"Sun2": "I don't think I've ever lived in such a small town before.#$b#Well, there was that one time my parents tried becoming hermits for a month as part of their latest performance art piece, but I don't think that counts.",

			"Mon4": "The other teens haven't really invited me to hang out yet. Maybe it's because I'm still new to the valley… I hope it's not because they think I'm crazy.", 
			"Tue4": "I don't know whether to be relieved or concerned that my parents haven't called in weeks.#$b#Maybe they lost my number...",
			"Wed4": "Did you know that over 200,000 murders have gone unsolved in the last four decades? And so many of the victims never move on...",
			"Thu4": "$q Q_Navyresponse1/Q_Navyresponse2 Q_Navy_fallback#You don't know anything about 20th century naval battles, do you? I swear this class is going to kill me.
				#$r Q_Navyresponse1 0 Q_Navy_reaction1#Uh, what?
				#$r Q_Navyresponse2 10 Q_Navy_reaction2#Yes, actually... [give a detailed lecture about 20th century naval battles]",
				"Q_Navyreaction1": "Yeah, not surprising. Like, when am I ever gonna need to know this stuff?#$b#Thanks, though.",
				"Q_Navyreaction2": "Wow, I can't believe you just knew all that. You're a lifesaver!$h",
				"Q_Navy_fallback": "Thanks again for your help with this assignment.$h",
			"Fri4": "%pet is so cute. I wish I had a pet, but there's no way Jenny would let me lease.",
			"Sat4": "Have you been exploring the mines? Charles says the lower levels are like, totally infested with poltergeists.",
			"Sun4": "Hey, @. You wouldn't happen to know anything about the local mermaids, would you? Charles says we might have to talk to them about our case.",

			"Mon6": "I've been wondering if I should learn how to cook. Gus makes great food and all, but when he's closed and I get home at 3am I'd like to not burn down the kitchen trying to make noodles.",
			"Tue6": "Jenny would probably be happy to buy any fish you catch off you. Apparently most people here are pescatarian.",
			"Wed6": "If Charles ever asks you to hold something while he digs in his bag, look out. One time he handed me a sack full of goat hearts like it was nothing. So gross…",
			"Thu6": "Juggling the agency and online classes can be a lot, but we're helping people, so it's worth it. ",
			"Fri6": "When it gets too loud in my head, I like to visit the spa. It's quiet there.",
			"Sat6": "I don't have much luck when it comes to growing plants like you. You should see the state of the tree I'm supposed to be taking care of.",
			"Sun6": "How are things on the farm going? It must be a lot of work.",

			"Mon8": "The other ghosts around town say that your farm should be, like, crazy haunted for how old it is. You haven't noticed anything strange, have you?",
			"Tue8": "Do you have any tips for what to do when a tree looks like it's wilting?#$b#Like, if the tree was metaphorical. Kind of. #$b#Never mind.",
			"Wed8": "I accidentally read Lewis' mind the other day when he handed me something.#$b#I did *not* need to know what he and Marnie get up to.",
			"Thu8": "I've been thinking about studying law after I graduate. There has to be some accountability for the living, because the dead only have us.",
			"Fri8": "If you see Edwin, can you tell him to get his ass over here?#$b#I think there are pixies in my vents again.",
			"Sat8": "Hey, if Edwin ever gives you any grief about hanging around like an unwanted stray, tell me? He pulled that shit when I first met them too.",
			"Sun8": "Being a psychic isn't everything it's cracked up to be.#$e#Sometimes I almost wish I could turn my brain off.",

			"Mon10": "Do you want to go to the saloon sometime? Gus has pretty good milkshakes.",
			"Tue10": "You should come over for movie night sometime. We won't even have to share popcorn with the boys.#$b#Just don't be surprised if Edwin guesses the ending, though...",
			"Wed10": "I'm really glad I met you, @. I feel way less alone.",
			"Thu10": "I don't really feel the need to go clubbing like I used to, but I do miss the dancing sometimes. Do you dance?",
			"Fri10": "It's really great everything you've done for the town. I try to help people out, but I never feel like I can make up for what I've done in the past.",
			"Sat10": "I had the weirdest dream last night. You were in it... Never mind.",
			"Sun10": "The boys do care, a lot, it's just… sometimes they forget what it's like to be alive. Maybe in thirty years stupid teenage bullshit won't matter, but it feels like it does now, you know?",	

			// Festivals and Events
			"spring_1": "",
			"summer_1": "It's getting so hot out. I could use a day at the beach to cool off.#$b#Or at least somewhere with air conditioning.",
			"fall_1": "Things are about to start getting busy in the spirit world.",
			"winter_1": "All this cold, wet weather reminds me of London.",
			"spring_12": "Are you excited for the flower dance? Kind of a weird, outdated holiday, but I guess it has its perks.",
			"summer_10": "What should I bring to the potluck? I can't cook for shit.",
			"summer_27": "I know they're not actually magic, but the dance of the moonlight jellies sure does feel like it.",
			"fall_15": "I don't remember the last time I went to the fair. I must have been little.", 
			"fall_26": "I don't have a costume for the festival tomorrow..#$e#Things have been so busy at the agency I feel like I've spent all month running around.",
			"winter_7": "Ice fishing isn't really my thing, but I bet you'd be great at it.",
			"winter_24": "I'm so excited for the Winter Star feast tomorrow.#$b#I wonder who drew my name in the gift exchange.",
